Simple WP Community Theme


Description: Simple WP Community Theme is a three-columns, widget-ready Buddypress theme. It comes in a dark dressy design with a community-navigation widget. It is 100% WP 3.5.1 compatible, e.g. custom menus. Also it has a custom header to change text color or add a logo or background-image.

The original author [Sven Lehner](https://github.com/svenl77) has transferred the theme to us for further maintenance and updates as a kind gesture to all WordPress folks using the BuddyPress child theme.

Pull requests are welcome.
